# Mitra RTP Healer - Usage Example

This project is a simple example of how to use the **Mitra RTP Healer** library, which helps with rendering RTSP video streams in WebRTC-compatible environments.  
It simulates an RTSP server and runs a conversion pipeline from RTSP to RTP/WebRTC, allowing you to preview the result using `ffplay`.

## Requirements

- Go 1.23+
- FFmpeg (with `ffplay` too) 

## How to Run

### 1. Start the simulated RTSP server

```bash
./mediamtx
```

## 2. Run the example using Mitra RTP Healer

```bash
go run main.go
```

This command starts the example app, which consumes the RTSP stream and applies Mitra RTP Healer processing.

## 3. Visualize the output using ffplay

```bash
ffplay -protocol_whitelist "file,udp,rtp" -loglevel debug -i stream.sdp
```
The stream.sdp file is generated by the example and contains the necessary info for ffplay to connect via RTP.
